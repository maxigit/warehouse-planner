This is a orgmode file. Each orgmode drawer contains a csv.
What is between drawer (as the present text is ignored)

The first drawer describes three shelves named respectively S1 , S2 and T1
:SHELVES:
name,comment,length,width,height,type
S1,,200,50,100,Shelf
S2,,200,50,150,Shelf
T1,,200,50,100,Shelf
:END:

The second drawer describes the boxes and in which shelf they are.
We have three boxes (called A) in S1 and six Bs in S2.
B have been tagged as `bg=blue` to set the background in blue.
:STOCKTAKE:
Bay No,Style,QTY,Length,Width,Height,Orientations
S1,A,3,50,50,50,
S2,B#bg=blue,6,50,50,50,
:END:


Finally, we need to describe the layout (how are shelves related to each other).
We want S2 to be on top of S1 and T1 next to it

:LAYOUT:
S1|S2 T1
:END:
